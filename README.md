# SmartBushFireRiskGaugeSystem
The project uses various sensors to identify the risk of a bushfire occurring. These sensors
include: a DHT22 sensor, a soil moisture sensor, a flame sensor and a smoke sensor. This system also connects with telegram which prompts the user when the sensors detect a value above threshold value.
